AI-Powered Video Generator SaaS
Tech Stack Recommendation:
Frontend: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS for UI
Backend: Node.js + Express
Storage: Firebase or Supabase for cloud storage
Voiceover: ElevenLabs API (Adam voice)
Video Processing: FFmpeg (for concatenation, overlay, and rendering)
Overview
Develop a two-page web app that allows users to generate videos by concatenating clips and adding AI-generated voiceovers. The app provides predefined footage categories, an optional hook, and a text box for custom scripts.

Page 2: Library
Functionality:
Ability to upload and manage clips for each category:
Motivation Footage
Gym Footage
Money Footage
Houses Footage
Women Footage
Cars Footage
Random Hooks
Uploads should be stored in Firebase/Supabase or a cloud storage solution.
The frontend should allow users to preview and delete uploaded clips.
Backend Features:
1. Video Generation Pipeline (FFmpeg Required)
Fetch selected footage from storage.
Concatenate clips into a single video using FFmpeg.
Generate AI voiceover using ElevenLabs API (Adam voice).
Overlay voiceover onto video using FFmpeg.
Render and return the final video file in MP4 (H.264) format.
2. Library Management:
Allow uploading new clips per category.
Store metadata for easy retrieval.
3. Authentication (Optional - If you want User Accounts):
Users can log in and manage their video assets.
API Integrations:
ElevenLabs API (Adam Voice) for AI Voiceover Generation
Cloud Storage (Firebase/Supabase) for Clip Management
FFmpeg for Video Processing (Concatenation, Overlay, Rendering)
Developer Notes:
FFmpeg is mandatory for concatenating clips, overlaying voiceovers, and exporting final videos efficiently.
Ensure all clips are in the same format (MP4, H.264, 30/60 FPS) to avoid re-encoding issues.
Optimize processing using GPU acceleration (if needed).
